# Cognition 003: Iteration Notes — From Idea to a Publishable Template (Sanitized)

This note captures the **real structural decisions** made during iteration, so the project doesn’t stay at the slogan level.

## 1) Fix outputs first, keep inputs flexible

The core bet is on **stable outputs**, not on “automated data sources” or “a specific AI platform”.

- Inputs can be messy: screenshots / chats / links / long-form text / command outputs…
- Outputs must be stable: People cards, Projects (TPCD), Signals, indexing rules

So the repo should define:

- what objects look like (fields / directories / naming)
- how to retrieve (keywords / tags)
- how to compile fragments into objects (skills / prompts)

## 2) Separate Protocol vs Infra

The easiest drift is stuffing executable logic into the protocol layer.

Final split:

- `00_Protocol/`: objects + rules only (schemas / glossary / usage / privacy baseline)
- `06_Infra/`: executable layer (skills, scripts, one-click tools)

Protocol stays stable; infra can iterate fast.

## 3) Numbered directories: ordering is meaning

The numbered prefixes (`00_..`, `01_..`, …) make ordering semantic:

- `01_Inbox` is the input gate
- `03_Goal-Projects` is action + decisions
- `04_Assets` / `05_Resources` clarifies ME vs MO

## 4) AI-native ingest: raw is optional

Many users instinctively save screenshots into `01_Inbox/raw/`.

In an AI-native workflow, the common path is:

> give screenshots/context directly to a code agent → write back structured objects only

Keep raw only when you need auditability / evidence.

## 5) Bilingual is not “double maintenance”

The real friction is long-term drift across duplicated content.

So we use langpacks + apply:

- `06_Infra/i18n/langpacks/<lang>/...` stores same-path variants
- `06_Infra/i18n/switch_language.py` applies key docs (README / prompts / skills)

## 6) Real example projects are the best onboarding

Pure templates are hard to learn from.

Putting sanitized example projects under `03_Goal-Projects/active/` makes “how to use it” concrete.
