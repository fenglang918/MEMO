# Preferences (Example)

> Sanitized example. Use it to learn the structure, then replace it with your own.

## Work Style

- Prefer:
  - Small-step iteration: ship a minimal end-to-end demo first, then abstract into protocol/templates.
  - Refactor > Append: turn fragments into objects instead of endlessly appending logs.
  - Always write “next step”: each interaction/thought should land in an action or explicit “no action”.
- Avoid:
  - Long-term PPT/alignment meetings without real outputs.
  - Vague goals with high pressure (“fast” without defining “correct”).

## Communication

- Prefer:
  - Align on goal + constraints: one-sentence goal + 3 boundaries + 1 acceptance criterion.
  - Lower frequency, higher quality: fewer pings, more batched updates.
- Avoid:
  - Mind-reading communication: emotion without information and context.

## Environment

- Prefer:
  - Long-term compounding: opportunities to turn work into publishable assets (papers/open-source/writing).
  - Boundary-respecting: basic respect for rest and deep-work time.
- Avoid:
  - Sustained uncertainty without hedging strategy (no transferable outputs, no exit path).

## Tooling

- Prefer:
  - Git + Markdown + full-text search (search-first).
  - Code agents for organizing/refactoring/archiving, not just writing chat summaries.
- Avoid:
  - Locking data into a single platform’s private format.
