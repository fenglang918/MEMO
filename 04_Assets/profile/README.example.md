# Profile / 个人简介

## Bio

I'm a researcher focused on **AI agents** and **synthetic data**.

My long-term research interest: **How can intelligence grow and scale, while remaining precisely calibrated to the complexity of the real world?**

Currently studying how to use **Agents** to synthesize data, improve LLM performance in **science-related domains**, and build the **benchmarks** that science needs.
