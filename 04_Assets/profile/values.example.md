# Values / 价值观

## Research Philosophy

> **How can intelligence grow and scale, while remaining precisely calibrated to the complexity of the real world?**

This question drives my research direction:
- **Synthetic Data**: As human-generated data is compressed into model intelligence, synthetic data becomes key for LLM self-learning and unbounded growth
- **Calibration**: Continuously design high-quality benchmarks to calibrate model intelligence
- **Reward Design**: Benchmarks are the ultimate reward in RL — propose challenging benchmarks, then use RL to train LLM self-learning

## Core Values

1. **Long-term thinking** - Value systems and protocols over quick hacks
2. **Ownership** - Own your data, own your memory, own your life
3. **Rational warmth** - Using rational tools (Git, Markdown, version control) to maintain memories and relationships

> **愿意为重要之物建立系统，本身就是一种温柔的理性。**  
> 因为足够在意，才不愿意让它们随意流失。
