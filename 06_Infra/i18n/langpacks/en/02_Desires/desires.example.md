# Desires (Example)

> Sanitized example. Use it to learn the structure, then replace it with your own.

## Active (Top)

- D-001: Build a portable personal memory system
  - Why: avoid platform lock-in; turn important decisions/relationships/projects into durable objects
  - Evidence: fragments drift across tools; hard to find original reasoning during reviews
  - Constraints: low maintenance; no heavy DB; privacy-first
  - Next step: pick 1 object type (People or Projects) and run an end-to-end loop → make it a TPCD project

- D-002: Build a stable mechanism for high-quality collaboration & referrals
  - Why: relationships are not a contact list; they should be searchable and actionable
  - Evidence: can’t recall the right person when needed; follow-ups drift
  - Next step: write 10 key people cards and run one follow-up cycle

## Later (Backlog)

- D-010: Publish a public writing/research portfolio
  - Why: make capabilities verifiable; reduce narrative-only CV claims
  - Next step: start with 1 publishable technical write-up

## Park (Uncertain)

- D-900: Build a visualization UI
  - Note: can be shareable, but easily turns into product engineering; wait until protocol is solid
