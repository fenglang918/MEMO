# Values (Example)

> Sanitized example. Use it to learn the structure, then replace it with your own.

## Core Values

- Truth & reviewability: prefer choices you can explain and later audit against your original intent.
- Long-term compounding: value assets that accumulate (skills, works, papers, relationships, reputation).
- Respectful collaboration: less blame-by-emotion; more alignment-by-structure.
- Gentle Rationality: build systems for what matters, but don’t let systems dominate life.

## Non-Goals

- Don’t treat “looking busy” as output.
- Don’t turn life into full-time metrics tracking (metrics serve decisions, not self-judgement).
- Don’t keep an “everything bucket” of notes; delete what can’t become an object.

## Red Lines (Non-negotiables)

- Never commit directly abusable secrets (passwords, API keys, private keys).
- Don’t sacrifice credibility for short-term gains (inflated claims, unverifiable references, opaque data).
- Don’t stay long-term in high-burn/low-return environments (no growth/output/respect).

## What This Constrains

- Project choice: prefer reproducible, deliverable, publishable work; avoid narrative-only projects.
- Collaboration: prefer people who align on expectations, respect boundaries, and share goal clarity.
- Tooling: default to search-first + repo-first; scripts are accelerators.

## Review

- Last reviewed: 2026-01-01
- Review triggers: major decisions (city/track/org changes) or sustained discomfort (2–4 weeks).
