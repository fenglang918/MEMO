# Desires

This is the upstream driver layer: what I want, what I don’t want, and what I value.

Treat it as the source for `03_Goal-Projects/` (projects), instead of writing goals directly as projects too early.

Minimal recommended set (extend when needed):

- `values.md`: values and refusal principles (non-goals / red lines)
- `preferences.md`: preferences and anti-preferences (work/life/collaboration style)
- `desires.md`: a desire backlog (grouped by topic + priority + last review)

This template also provides `*.example.md` as sanitized examples (structure/writing style only).
